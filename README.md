# 🧪 Inferential Statistics - Medicon Dose Testing

Statistical quality control and confidence interval estimation for COVID-19 vaccine batch effectiveness.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

This project evaluates the effectiveness of the sixth batch of COVID-19 vaccine doses produced by Medicon. Using inferential statistics and Python-based analysis, we estimate the probability of unsatisfactory doses and assess time-of-effect data using confidence intervals. The goal is to ensure batch quality and provide actionable insights for quality assurance and future production planning.

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Binomial and normal distribution modeling for dose success/failure
- ✅ Probability calculations for specific scenarios (e.g., 3 unsatisfactory doses)
- ✅ Confidence interval estimation using real-world sample data
- ✅ Visualization of probability distributions and percentiles

## 📊 Results

- 📈 The binomial model showed <1% chance of more than 3 unsatisfactory doses out of 100
- 📈 The 90th percentile time of effect was estimated around _X_ hours (based on data)
- 🧠 The 95% confidence interval for time of effect indicated high consistency in dose performance
